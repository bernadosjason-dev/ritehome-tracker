# Tracker development instructions

Follow the application rules in README.md, including `track()` for database writes
and bumping `PAGE_VERSION` whenever index.html changes.

The owner requires storage verification whenever upload controls are added or
changed. Identify the actual destination and check its configured storage access,
write permission, sharing permission, file limits and error handling. This tracker
uses a Google Drive receipt folder rather than an object-storage bucket. Exercise
success, permission/capacity failures and retries; retain form data on failures.
Verify real storage when authorized runtime access is available. If live access
is unavailable, state that limitation and provide a usable live storage check;
never describe simulated tests as proof of live storage readiness.

Procurement validation lives in procurement.js and is embedded in backend/Code.gs
so the complete Apps Script remains deployable by copying one file. Keep the core
validation functions identical; the procurement tests detect drift. Test split
supplier quantities, five BOMs, over-allocation, deliveries, cancellation, revision
conflicts and replayed writes when changing procurement. Procurement uses Google
Sheets, with no raw BOM document storage; do not describe pasted Excel values as
file uploads or a document-scanning capability.
